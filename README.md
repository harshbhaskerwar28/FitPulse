# AndroFit Coach ‚Äì AI Voice & Vision Personal Trainer

---

üîπ **1. Concept Overview**

AndroFit Coach brings the energy of a real-life personal trainer straight to your headphones and webcam. Using state-of-the-art voice recognition and computer-vision form tracking, the agent listens to your commands (e.g., "Start leg day", "Switch to cardio"), watches your movements through any laptop or phone camera, and delivers instant, upbeat coaching. It calls out reps, corrects posture, and keeps you motivated with personalised banter and smart progressions.

By freeing you from staring at a screen or scrolling an app, AndroFit Coach creates a truly hands-free workout. Whether you need a gentle stretch after sitting all day or a high-intensity HIIT blast, the trainer adapts on-the-fly to fatigue, equipment on hand, or sudden changes of plan. A unique highlight is its Vision Feedback Loop: as soon as the camera detects form breakdown (knees caving in a squat, hips sagging in a plank) the coach corrects you verbally in <0.5 s, just like a pro in the gym.

Additional built-in perks include multilingual support (10+ languages), automatic playlist curation from Spotify/Apple Music to match workout tempo, and weekly progress snapshots delivered to your inbox. The result is an engaging, personalised and science-driven fitness experience‚Äîno human trainer required.

üîπ **2. Prompt Engineering Plan**

### A. Strategy
1. **Intent Detection** ‚Äì A system prompt instructs the LLM to recognise workout intents (start, stop, switch, modify intensity) plus FAQ queries.
2. **Dynamic Response Templates** ‚Äì Chat context variables feed the user's goals, fatigue level, equipment list and language preference.
3. **Adjustable Persona** ‚Äì A `coach_mode` parameter toggles between *Drill-Sergeant*, *Chill Buddy* and *Physio-Focus* tones while preserving safety guidance.

### B. Example Prompts
| Prompt | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| *"You are an AI personal trainer. The user says: 'Start a 15-minute cardio workout.' Respond cheerfully with 3 beginner exercises and a quick warm-up."* | Tests plan-generation & friendly tone |
| *"User: 'I can't do this anymore!'*" | Evaluates motivational empathy & adaptive scaling |
| *"User: 'How do I do a plank correctly?'*" | Checks concise, safety-first form instruction |
